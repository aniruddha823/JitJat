# JitJat

## Description
JitJat, inspired by the word "chit-chat", is an iOS-based messaging application. You can sign up, add friends, and chat with them about whatever you choose. I tried to make it look as minimal as possible & took some cues from other popular messaging services. This app was developed in Swift, uses Firebase to securely store messages, and implements various third-party libraries for some UI elements & background tasks.
